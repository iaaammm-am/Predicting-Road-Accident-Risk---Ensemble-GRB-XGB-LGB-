##  Predicting-Road-Accident-Risk---Ensemble-GRB-XGB-LGB-
# Predicting Road Accident Risk
Developed Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM models with K-Fold cross-validation, including feature engineering and model optimization. Combined multiple models using ensemble techniques and applied prediction calibration to improve performance on real-world road accident risk prediction.
# Project Overview
This project explores predicting the risk of road accidents using historical data. It includes data preprocessing, model training, ensemble methods, and prediction calibration. The repository demonstrates the full workflow from raw data to predictive modeling.
# Note
This is my first project, and Iâ€™m happy to receive any feedback or suggestions. Open to discussions and improvements!
